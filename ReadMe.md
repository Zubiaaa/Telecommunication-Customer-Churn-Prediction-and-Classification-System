# Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction and Classification System

## Background/Scenario:
You are working as an AI engineer at a reputable organisation. You have a client from the telecommunication sector who is facing a customer churn problem due to fierce competition in the market. Customer churn, also known as ‘customer attrition’, is defined as the rate at which customers stop using an organisation’s services within a certain timeframe. Your client is interested in applying AI techniques to explore and model its customer data. This modelling can help the company to forecast their customers’ behaviour and potentially help reduce the churn rate. You have carried out initial data exploration and found:
●	The data provided by the company is imbalanced as there are far more retained customers than ‘churn’ customers.
●	The data contains numeric and nominal attributes.
●	There are a few missing values in the data.
You’ve had a meeting with your client and have agreed to model the data using artificial intelligence techniques - namely, supervised learning and feature selection optimisation. Feature selection is important in removing irrelevant attributes and helps reduce computation cost. You are expected to present a report to your client by constructing two robust models which must follow the guidelines presented below:
●	Design and build a supervised learning model on the full data.
●	Use optimisation techniques (learned in this module) to find a subset of relevant features.
●	Design and build a supervised learning model on the derived subset of features.
●	Critically evaluate the two learning models (with and without feature selection).
●	Evaluate the robustness of the generated models by applying appropriate validation techniques (and identifying a suitable subset of data for validation).
While setting the parameters of the optimisation methods, pay special attention to selecting an appropriate fitness function (evaluation criteria). The fitness function plays an important role in evolving the potential solutions and setting the direction of the search. 
The dataset is provided by the client.

## Tasks:
The task is to design and build solutions based on the discussed scenario and the data provided. You should clearly draw on the current literature.

## Steps:
I have separted my whole code into 6 files. Each file is a stage/step of the algorithm.

Files are divided into the following steps:
Step 1: Data Cleaning
Step 2: Data Preprocessing

#### Using Imbalancing Dataset
Step 3: Classification without Feature Selection 
Step 4: Feature Selection and Classification

#### Using Balanced Dataset
Step 5: Classification without Feature Selection Using Balancing Technique
Step 6: Feature Selection and Classification Using Balancing Technique

I have used the same file names as the steps name stated above. Thanks!
